          Hi, I'm <strong>Shahar</strong> — a technology leader passionate about building products
          that make a difference. I write about technology, leadership, and what's coming next.
        </p>

        <p>
          With years of experience in software engineering and product leadership, I've learned
          that the most interesting stories live at the intersection of technology and human impact.
          This blog is where I explore those intersections.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Write About</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Looking Ahead</strong> covers the topics I find myself thinking about most:
          emerging technologies, the craft of building software, leadership lessons learned the
          hard way, and perspectives on where our industry is heading.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whether it's a deep dive into a technical challenge, reflections on leading engineering
          teams, or observations about trends shaping our future — I aim to share insights that
          are honest, practical, and worth your time.
        </p>

        <h2>Get in Touch</h2>

        <p>
          I enjoy connecting with fellow builders, thinkers, and curious minds.

          connect with me on LinkedIn.
